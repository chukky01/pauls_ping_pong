# pauls_ping_pong
This is my very own versio of the once famous ping-pong game
The rules here are simple. There is a ball and two paddles.
The speed of the ball increases when the ball hits the paddle
The speed of the ball resets its speed when either of the players fails to hit the ball back
Each failure to hit the back results in the opponent gaining a point
For the left paddle the controls are the "w" key for up and the "s" key for down
While for the right paddle the controls are simply the "up" key for up and the "down" key for down
